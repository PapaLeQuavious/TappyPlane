# Game Development test learning project

This game was created as a learning exercise while following the [Udemy course by Richard Allbert](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-2d-game-development-godot-43-c-from-scratch/?couponCode=CP130525US).

## Disclaimer

- **Game assets** used in this project are **not mine** and are included as part of the course materials.
- The **code** was written by me, but was curated and guided heavily by Richard throughout the tutorial.

## Goals

- Learn the fundamentals of game development.
- Understand how to structure and write game logic.
- Gain practical experience through hands-on projects.

## Future Plans

After completing the course:

- These small games will be revisited and improved using the new knowledge gained.
- If development proves enjoyable, polished versions of the games may be uploaded to [itch.io](https://itch.io) as free releases.
